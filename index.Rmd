## Project Overview

* Visualize the NEISS product injuries data for 2014
  * The NEISS collects product-related injury data from select US emergency rooms and extrapolates to the entire US
* Focus on injuries that are not uniformly distributed throughout the year

--- .class #id 

## Potential Uses

* Timely targeted public outreach campaigns
  * Increase safety awareness
  * Reduce seasonal injuries
* Provide additional training to medical and EMS personnel on expected injuries

## Example Plot

Here's a compelling example for July, showing the seasonal spikes in swimming, fireworks, and yard care injuries.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

load("./shiny/seasonal_injuries/data/monthly.Rdata")
load("./shiny/seasonal_injuries/data/yearly.Rdata")

min_inj_products <- subset(yearly, num >= 10000)$prod1

top_monthly <- monthly %>%
  filter(prod1 %in% min_inj_products) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  top_n(10, portion)

month_products <- subset(top_monthly, month %in% c('Jul'))$prod1

graph_data <- monthly %>%
  filter(
    prod1 %in% (month_products)
  )

ggplot(graph_data) +
  geom_line(aes(month, num, group = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~prod1, scales = 'free_y') +
  labs(x = 'Month', y = 'Injuries')

```
